# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. Weâ€™ll use the Sentiment140 dataset, which consists of 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API.

Project Overview
Problem Statement: Classify tweets into positive or negative sentiments.
Dataset: The Sentiment140 Dataset.
Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
Logistic Regression
Bernoulli Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Feature Representation: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
Performance Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy and F1 Scores.
Data Preprocessing: Natural Language Processing (NLP) using NLTK library.
